 In the first three semesters, you learned about C programming, some VERILOG and some assembly language programming. In this lab, you are going to learn to code in Python. Python is one of the most popular programming languages of today. Itâ€™s simplicity in syntax, availability of a large number of open source libraries and the amazing open source community support makes it the favorite for scientists. \\

\begin{equation*}
 V_{n1}-V_{n2}=L_{n1,n2} \frac{dI_{n1,n2}}{dt}
\end{equation*}
\section{Dealing with codes}
To type block of code manually use the following block
\begin{verbatim}
